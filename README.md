# Project Title: Room Occupancy Prediction Model Using Machine Learning

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a predictive model to accurately determine room occupancy status based on environmental sensor data. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze sensor inputs and provide real-time occupancy predictions, enhancing energy efficiency, security, and space utilization in smart buildings.

## Objective
The primary objective of this model is to predict whether a room is occupied based on input features, including temperature, humidity, light, and CO₂ levels. By accurately forecasting occupancy, the model can help optimize heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and improve building management systems (BMS).

## Data and Features
The model uses a dataset comprising sensor readings collected over time, with the following key features:

- **Temperature**: Ambient room temperature.
- **Humidity**: Relative humidity in the room.
- **Light**: Light intensity levels, indicating lighting conditions.
- **CO₂ Levels**: Concentration of carbon dioxide as a proxy for human presence.
- **Humidity Ratio**: Derived from temperature and humidity to indicate air moisture levels.

## Target Variable
- **Occupancy Status**: A binary variable indicating whether the room is occupied (`1`) or vacant (`0`).
